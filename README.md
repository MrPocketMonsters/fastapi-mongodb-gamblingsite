# Simple REST API service with FastAPI and MongoDB

This is my first time using FastAPI and MongoDB. With this project, I aim to understand and have a first approach to these tools. It will also help as a first approach to documentation for a project.

## How to install this project.

This project runs on [Python 3.11.10](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-31110/), so the first thing is getting it.

1. Navigate to the desired containing folder using the terminal.
2. Clone this project using `git clone https://github.com/MrPocketMonsters/fastapi-mongodb-gamblingsite.git`.
A new folder `/fastapi-mongodb-gamblingsite` with the project will be created.
3. Navigate to the project folder using `cd fastapi-mongodb-gamblingsite`.
4. Install all required Python libraries using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
This will install on your PC:
    * The official MongoDB Python client.
    * The FastAPI library for RestAPIs.
    * The Uvicorn Web Server.
    * Dependencies for these libraries.
